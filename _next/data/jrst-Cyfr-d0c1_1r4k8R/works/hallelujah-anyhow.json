It is an expanding collection, with new items added as they come in. The posters within the collection relate to events held on campus, including music and dance performances, film screenings, talks, seminars, panels, book talks, auditions, career fairs, job opportunities, research studies and course openings, among others. Some events reoccur across time. These events include Homecoming, sports game schedules, concert series held at Bienen School of Music, performances by on-campus theater groups such as Waa-mu and the Northwestern Student Theatre Coalition (StuCo), and, from 2010 onward, One Book Northwestern.
